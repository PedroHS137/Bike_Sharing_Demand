# Bike_Sharing_Demand
kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand, predict bike sharing demand using the AutoGluon Framework and by perfoming feature engineering to the data.

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated
via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it
to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival
location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded.
